This repository holds a fullstack web application utilizing the MERN stack. 

It is a to-do list application that allows the user to create, read, update, and delete tasks and their accompanying descriptions on their list. Each task is stored within a database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. 

The backend component is a RESTful API developed using MongoDB/Mongoose, Express,js, and Node.js to create the database component of the application. 

The frontend component is a UI developed using React.js that uses the CRUD functionality from the backend. 

The build itself was definitely a challenge, especially when it came to creating both the front and backend aspects of the app, and the biggest challenge was in using React as a framework for the user interface, as this project was my first undertaking with React on a larger scale. 

One thing that I'd like to refactor is the update function in React, I can't figure out why the list contents will not update without the user having to refresh the window.
